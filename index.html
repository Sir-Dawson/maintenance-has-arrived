	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
	<p>Introduce yourself and your cleaning requirements. 
	<br>The better we can understand your specific needs, 
	<br>the better we can tailor a solution.</p>

	<h2>Pile Preparation (Optional):</h2>
	<p>If your carpet/Upholstery is medium to heavily soiled then we will vacuum the carpet as required. 
	<br>You can save money by making sure yours is already done.</p>

	<h2>Chemical Application:</h2>
	<p>Chemical spray specific to your requirements is applied on all carpet/upholstery surfaces. 
	<br>There is a range of products specifically selected to meet environmentally safe standards.</p>

	<h2>Hot water extraction:</h2>
	<p>Hot water is locally forced through the carpet/upholstery pile to the base of the fibres. 
	<br>The dirty water is subsequently sucked out by a high pressure vacuum. 
	<br>This task is performed by industry specific hardware that is designed and developed here in Australia.</p>

	<h2>Spot Treatment:</h2>
	<p>Stains requiring additional attention are spot treated with a carefully selected chemical. 
	<br>This is followed by additional hot water extraction.</p>

	<h2>Cleanup:</h2>
	<p>Any Furniture with timber feet are capped to avoid staining.</p>
