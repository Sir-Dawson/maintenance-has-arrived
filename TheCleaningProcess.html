<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>We ask you to introduce us to yourself and your cleaning requirements. 
The better we can understand your specific needs, the better we can tailor a solution.</p>

<h3>Pile Preparation (Optional):</h3>
<p>If your carpet/Upholstery is medium to heavily soiled then we will vacuum the carpet as required. 
You can save money by making sure yours is already done.</p>

<h3>Chemical Application:</h3>
<p>Chemical spray specific to your requirements is applied on all carpet/upholstery surfaces. 
There is a range of products specifically selected to meet environmentally safe standards.</p>

<h3>Hot water extraction:</h3>
<p>Hot water is locally forced through the carpet/upholstery pile to the base of the fibres. 
The dirty water is subsequently sucked out by a high pressure vacuum. 
This task is performed by industry specific hardware that is designed and developed here in Australia.</p>

<h3>Spot Treatment:</h3>
<p>Stains requiring additional attention are spot treated with a carefully selected chemical. 
This is followed by additional hot water extraction.</p>

<h3>Cleanup:</h3>
<p>Any Furniture with timber feet are capped to avoid staining.</p>
